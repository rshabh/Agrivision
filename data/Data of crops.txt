Principles of Plant Disease Control:

Plant diseases are caused by biotic pathogens like bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and viruses.
Disease management involves integrated practices targeting the disease triangle components.
Proper diagnosis is crucial to avoid misidentification and ineffective control measures.
Causes and Measures for Different Diseases in Crops:

Alfalfa diseases include seedling blights, root and crown rots, and leaf blights.
To manage alfalfa diseases, use winter-hardy, disease-resistant varieties, high-quality disease-free seed, and well-drained seedbeds.
Chemical Groups and Fungicide Resistance Risk:

FRAC codes for fungicides on common field crops in Illinois include MBC, DMI, Phenylamides, Carboxamides, QoI, Phenylpyrroles, Multi-site activity.
Risk of fungicide resistance varies from high to low based on the chemical group.
Managing Diseases for Alfalfa:

Control alfalfa diseases by growing resistant varieties, using disease-free seed, and providing well-drained seedbeds.
Contact, locally systemic, and upwardly systemic fungicides can be used for disease management in alfalfa.
Fertilizers and Planting Practices:

Balanced nitrogen forms can help reduce disease severity in wheat crops.
Proper planting time, site selection, crop rotation, and fungicide treatments are essential for disease management in wheat.

Corn Diseases and Control Measures:
Seed Rots and Seedling Blights: Plant high-quality, injury-free seed into soils above 50°F. Proper seedbed preparation and correct placement of fertilizer, herbicides, and insecticides are crucial.
Stewart’s Bacterial Wilt: Early control of flea beetles can be beneficial for susceptible hybrids. Some insecticide seed treatments may offer this control.
Goss’s Bacterial Wilt: Rotations of 2 or more years provide excellent control against this disease.
Helminthosporium Leaf Blights: Foliar fungicide applications may be necessary for susceptible hybrids under favorable disease conditions.
Gray Leaf Spot: Similar control measures as for Helminthosporium leaf blights may be applicable.
Physoderma Brown Spot: Control measures include high-quality seed and proper planting practices.
Yellow Leaf Blight and Eyespot: Similar control strategies as for Helminthosporium leaf blights may apply.
Anthracnose: Effective control methods include resistant or tolerant varieties, crop rotation, and high-quality seed.
Common and Southern Rusts: Foliar fungicides may be needed in specific conditions for common rust.
Common Smut: Prevention involves avoiding mechanical injuries to plants and controlling insects.
Crazy Top and Sorghum Downy Mildew: Planting resistant sorghums and controlling shattercane are key preventive measures.
Stalk Rots: Planting adapted hybrids at recommended populations, controlling insects, and scouting for potential losses are essential.
Ear and Kernel Rots: Control measures include managing stalk rots and leaf blights, selecting hybrids with well-covered ears, and scouting at appropriate moisture levels.

Wheat Diseases and Control Measures:
Seedling Blights: Effective control methods include planting disease-resistant varieties and high-quality seed.
Take-All: Planting after the fly-free date and crop rotation are important control measures.
Stem Rust: Planting disease-resistant varieties is crucial for managing stem rust.
Leaf Rust: Similar control strategies as for stem rust may be applicable.
Stripe Rust: Planting resistant varieties is key to managing stripe rust effectively.
Septoria and Stagonospora Leaf Blotches: Seed treatment can control seedborne infection, and avoiding bin-run seed is recommended.
Tan Spot: Proper management includes crop rotation and planting disease-resistant varieties.
Cephalosporium Stripe: Control measures may involve selecting high-quality seed and avoiding bin-run seed.
Powdery Mildew: Planting disease-resistant varieties and using foliar spray or fungicides can help manage powdery mildew effectively.
Helminthosporium Spot Blotch: Control methods include planting high-quality seed and using foliar spray or fungicides when necessary.
Fusarium Head Blight (Scab): Avoiding planting into corn stubble and selecting high-quality seed are important control measures.
Black Chaff: Planting disease-resistant varieties and avoiding bin-run seed are crucial for managing black chaff effectively.
Soilborne Wheat Mosaic Virus: Planting after the fly-free date and using balanced fertility practices can help reduce the severity of this disease.
Wheat Spindle Streak Virus: Planting disease-resistant varieties and using foliar spray or fungicides can aid in managing this virus effectively.

Soybean Diseases and Control Measures:
Pod and Stem Blight, Anthracnose, Purple Seed Stain, Septoria Brown Spot: The time from maturity to harvest affects disease likelihood, with early-maturing varieties being less affected by brown stem rot.
Soybean Growth Habit: Tall, bushy varieties may be more susceptible to Sclerotinia stem rot, while shorter varieties may be prone to water-splashed pathogens.
Planting Dates: Early planting may increase seedling blights and sudden death syndrome incidence.
Crop Rotation and Tillage: Crucial for controlling most soybean diseases as pathogens depend on crop residues for overwintering.
Row Spacing: Diseases thrive in cool, wet conditions with rows less than 30 inches potentially increasing disease levels.
Humidity Influence: Diseases like downy mildew and Sclerotinia stem rot are greatly affected by high humidity.
Soybean Cyst Nematode: Effective control involves avoiding planting the same variety twice in a field and rotating varieties with different resistance sources.

Choosing Planting Sites and Crop Rotation
Planting Sites: Select well-drained planting sites to reduce disease risks. Consider the pathogen survival between seasons.

Crop Rotation: Rotate crops to manage diseases effectively. Different crops can help break disease cycles and reduce pathogen buildup.

Solutions for Disease Management
Resistant Varieties: Choose disease-resistant varieties to combat specific pathogens common in the area.

Proper Fertilization: Maintain balanced fertility levels to reduce disease losses and promote plant health.

Timely Cutting: Cut crops in a timely manner to minimize loss to foliar blights and maintain overall plant health.
