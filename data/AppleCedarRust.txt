**Cedar Apple Rust**

**1. Disease Overview:**
   - **Description:** Cedar Apple Rust (*Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae*) is a fungal disease affecting apple trees and related species, requiring two host plants: juniper trees (family Cupressaceae) and apple/crabapple trees (family Rosaceae). It is known for orange-red spots on leaves and sometimes fruit, causing aesthetic damage and potential crop loss.
   - **Affected Crops:** Primarily affects apple and crabapple trees, and occasionally hawthorn and serviceberry.

**2. Symptoms of Cedar Apple Rust:**
   - **Leaf Symptoms:**
     - **Early Stage:** Small, pale yellow pinhead-sized spots on the upper surface of leaves.
     - **Advanced Stage:** Spots enlarge to bright orange-yellow with red borders. 
     - **Fungal Tubes:** Short, finger-like tubes on the lower surface of leaves, releasing yellow to orange spores.
   - **Fruit Symptoms:**
     - **Appearance:** Green to brown irregular spots with black dots; affects fruit quality and marketability.
   - **Branch Symptoms:**
     - **Galls:** Reddish-brown galls on infected junipers that swell and produce orange, gelatinous structures in wet weather.

**3. Disease Life Cycle:**
   - **Overwintering:** Galls on junipers and red cedar trees overwinter and remain reddish-brown.
   - **Spore Release:** In early spring, galls produce bright orange fungal growths that release spores to Rosaceae plants.
   - **Infection:** Spores infect leaves and fruit on Rosaceae plants, potentially reinfecting junipers or red cedars.
   - **Seasonal Changes:** Galls rehydrate and dry out multiple times; spores are produced during wet periods and cease in warm, dry weather. Galls die after one season, while cankers and broom rust can remain dormant.

**4. Preventive Measures:**
   - **Cultural Practices:**
     - **Eliminate Alternate Hosts:** Remove junipers within a 5 km radius of apple orchards to disrupt the rust fungus lifecycle.
     - **Historical Precedents:** Laws like Miller v. Schoene reflect the economic importance of apple orchards.
   - **Chemical Treatments:**
     - **Fungicides:** Use fenarimol and triforine post-infection; they reduce pycnial formation with control rates up to 100%.
     - **Internal Absorption Compounds:** Bactericides with internal absorption offer effective control and reduce environmental impact.
   - **Plant Resistance:**
     - **Flavonoid Accumulation:** Flavonoids like anthocyanin and catechin enhance rust resistance; breeding programs focus on these traits.
   - **Crop Rotation & Host Management:**
     - Avoid planting eastern red cedar and juniper near susceptible Rosaceae plants.
     - Regularly inspect and prune infected junipers and red cedars.
   - **Hygiene:** 
     - Remove and dispose of infected plant material; prune infected twigs or branches from Rosaceae plants.
   - **Cultural Controls:** Manage minor infections to prevent significant leaf loss.

**5. Treatment Options:**
   - **Chemical Control:**
     - **Fungicides:** Fenarimol and triforine offer effective control. Fenarimol at 20-40 µg/ml provides 96-99% control; triforine at 240 µg/ml offers 80-83% control.
   - **Cultural Practices:**
     - **Removal of Alternate Hosts:** Historically enforced in regions like Virginia to protect apple orchards.
   - **Genetic Resistance:**
     - **Breeding for Resistance:** Genetic variability in apple cultivars; some exhibit natural resistance controlled by major genes.

**6. Impact on Yield:**
   - **Fruit Quality:** External rust symptoms reduce marketability; interior of fruit usually remains unaffected.
   - **Yield Reduction:** Extensive leaf infections cause premature leaf drop, reducing photosynthesis and fruit yield.

**7. Environmental Factors:**
   - **Weather Conditions:**
     - **Temperature and Moisture:** Thrives in temperatures between 52°F and 77°F (11°C to 25°C) with wet conditions for spore germination.
     - **Moisture:** Teliospores need soaking for spore production; wet conditions are essential for infection.
   - **Light Conditions:** UV light affects basidiospore survival; cloudy conditions may favor rust persistence.
   - **Soil and Environmental Conditions:**
     - Thrives where cedar and apple trees coexist, often in high humidity and frequent rainfall areas.
     - Proper soil drainage is crucial; avoid waterlogged soils.

**8. Rust Fungi Overview:**
   - Cedar apple rust requires two host plants from different families. The interaction between junipers and Rosaceae plants complicates disease management.
