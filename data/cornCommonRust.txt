**Disease Name:** Common Rust  
**Pathogen:** Puccinia sorghi

**Description:**  
Common rust is a fungal disease affecting corn plants, prevalent in areas with moderate temperatures and high humidity. The pathogen produces spores dispersed by the wind, leading to widespread infection under suitable conditions.

### Symptoms

**Early Symptoms:**  
- Small, circular to elongated lesions on leaves, often in clusters.  
- Lesions may initially be yellowish with a faint halo.

**Mature Symptoms:**  
- Lesions become elongated; fungus erupts through the leaf surface.  
- Characterized by brownish-red oblong pustules that can rub off on fingers.  
- Lesions are found on both upper and lower leaf surfaces.

**Late Symptoms:**  
- Pustules darken as black teliospores develop within the lesions.  
- Both brownish-red and black spores may be present, eventually leading to only black teliospores.

### Disease Life Cycle

**Initial Infection:**  
- Fungus overwinters in tropical and subtropical regions.  
- In spring, spores are carried by wind to new locations, infecting corn plants.

**Spore Stages:**  
- The pathogen undergoes multiple spore stages.  
- Urediniospores spread infection during the growing season.

**Secondary Infections:**  
- Disease spreads rapidly through additional spore production, leading to repeated infection cycles.

**End of Season:**  
- Fungus produces black teliospores that become dormant, completing the life cycle.

### Preventive Measures

**Genetic Resistance:**  
- **Resistant Varieties:** Plant resistant corn varieties like Liyu products, Indimyt 345, MI-12, NK-6240, and CP-808.  
- **Hybrid Selection:** Choose hybrids with high resistance ratings from seed suppliers.

**Cultural Practices:**  
- **Early Sowing & Weeding:** Reduce favorable conditions for rust development.  
- **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-gramineous crops and remove plant debris.  
- **Fertilization:** Adjust fertilization practices, reducing nitrogen and increasing phosphorus and potassium.

**Chemical Control:**  
- **Fungicides:** Use Azoxystrobin, ciproconazole + azoxystrobin, and trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole preventively.  
- **Application Timing:** Apply early in the disease cycle and consider difenoconazole and tebuconazole for management.

**Field Scouting:**  
- **Regular Monitoring:** Scout for early signs of rust and track weather conditions favoring rust development.  
- **Sanitation:** Clean equipment thoroughly to prevent spore spread.

### Treatment Options

**Chemical Control:**  
- **Fungicides:** Tebuconazole, Hexaconazole, and combinations like trifloxystrobin + tebuconazole.  
- **Application Timing:** Early sprays and repeated applications are effective.

**Biological and Integrated Approaches:**  
- **Biological Agents:** Use Trichoderma viride with neem and garlic extracts.  
- **Integrated Disease Management (IDM):** Combine host plant resistance with chemical treatments for better control.

**Genetic Resistance:**  
- **Quantitative Resistance:** Utilize QTL identified for resistance through marker-assisted selection or genomic selection.

### Impact on Yield

**Photosynthesis Reduction:**  
- Rust lesions decrease functional leaf area, lowering photosynthesis and sugar production.

**Weakened Stalks:**  
- Reduced sugar leads to weakened stalks and increased risk of stalk rot.

**Poor Kernel Filling:**  
- Insufficient photosynthesis results in poorly filled kernels and reduced yield.

**Increased Lodging:**  
- Weakened stalks are prone to lodging, causing harvest losses.

**Timing of Infection:**  
- Early infections, especially before silking, cause significant yield losses. Later infections have lesser impact.

### Environmental Factors

**Weather Conditions:**  
- **Cool, Moist Weather:** Favors rust development with temperatures between 60-77°F (15-25°C) and high humidity.  
- **Prolonged Leaf Wetness:** Extended periods of leaf wetness are ideal for fungal growth.  
- **Hot, Dry Weather:** Suppresses rust development.

**Soil Conditions:**  
- **Indirect Influence:** Healthy soil supports plant vigor, helping resist infections.  
- **Dense Plant Populations:** High densities increase humidity, favoring rust development.
