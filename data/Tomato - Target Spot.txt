## Tomato - Target Spot

### 1. Symptoms of Target Spot
- **Early Stages:**
  - Small, water-soaked spots appear on the lower leaves.
  - Spots turn into circular or irregular brown spots with a target-like pattern.
- **Advanced Stages:**
  - Spots enlarge, merge, and cause premature yellowing and dropping of leaves.
  - Lesions develop on stems, fruit, and petioles, leading to fruit rot.
- **Leaf Symptoms:**
  - Concentric rings within the spots, surrounded by a yellow halo.
  - Dark, velvety fungal growth on the undersides of leaves.
- **Stem and Fruit Symptoms:**
  - Dark, sunken spots with a concentric ring pattern develop on stems and fruit.

### 2. Disease Life Cycle
- **Initial Infection:**
  - Fungus *Corynespora cassiicola* survives in infected plant debris and soil.
  - Spores are spread by wind, rain, and contaminated tools.
- **Spread:**
  - Most severe during warm, humid conditions (24°C to 30°C).
- **Infection Process:**
  - Spores germinate and penetrate the leaf surface, causing spots.
  - Multiple cycles of spores can be produced during the growing season.
- **Overwintering:**
  - Fungus can survive on plant debris or in the soil, causing recurring infections.

### 3. Preventive Measures
- **Chemical Control:**
  - **Fungicides:** Use azoxystrobin, mancozeb, and fumoxate to reduce disease severity.
  - **SAR Activators:** Use Acibenzolar-S-methyl to reduce defoliation by 42%.
- **Biological Control:**
  - **Biocontrol Agents:** Use Trichoderma harzianum to inhibit related pathogens.
- **Cultural and Physical Methods:**
  - **Soil and Plant Management:** Improve soil properties with microbial fertilizers.
  - **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting tomatoes in the same area for consecutive seasons.
  - **Resistant Varieties:** Use disease-resistant tomato varieties.
  - **Hygiene:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris.
  - **Mulching:** Apply mulch to prevent soil splash.
  - **Irrigation:** Water early in the morning, use drip irrigation.

### 4. Treatment Options
- **Chemical Control:**
  - Use fungicides containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based products.
  - Apply at the first sign of disease; repeat as necessary.
- **Organic Treatment:**
  - Apply neem oil or sulfur-based sprays as preventive measures.
  - Remove and destroy infected leaves.
- **Integrated Management Strategies:**
  - Combine chemical treatments with biological agents and environmental modifications.

### 5. Impact on Yield
- **Leaf Loss:**
  - Severe infections lead to significant leaf loss, reducing photosynthesis.
- **Fruit Quality:**
  - Infected fruit may develop lesions and rot, becoming unmarketable.
- **Yield Reduction:**
  - Combined effects can lead to substantial yield losses.

### 6. Disease-Resistant Crop Varieties
- **Tomato Varieties:**
  - Consult local agricultural extensions or seed suppliers for resistant varieties.

### 7. Environmental Factors
- **Weather Conditions:**
  - Warm, humid conditions with frequent rainfall favor the disease.
- **Soil Conditions:**
  - Poorly drained soils or areas with high organic matter harbor the fungus.
- **Microclimate:**
  - Dense planting and poor air circulation increase the risk of disease.
