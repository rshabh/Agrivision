**Strawberry Leaf Scorch Diseases - Overview**

### 1. Symptoms of Each Disease

**a. Leaf Spot (Mycosphaerella fragariae)**  
- **Early Symptoms:**  
  - Circular, deep purple spots on the upper surfaces of leaves.
  - Small, distinct spots initially.
- **Progression:**  
  - Spots enlarge, centers turn grayish to white.
  - Younger leaf spots become light brown, bordered by reddish-purple to rusty brown.
  - Superficial black spots may form on fruit, typically around groups of seeds, with each spot being about Â¼ inch in diameter.
  - Severe infections increase the number of spots.

**b. Leaf Scorch (Diplocarpon earliana)**  
- **Early Symptoms:**  
  - Numerous small, irregular, purplish spots or blotches on the upper leaf surface.
- **Progression:**  
  - Centers of blotches become brownish.
  - Blotches merge, causing the leaf to turn purplish to reddish-brown.
  - Infected petals may wither and fall.
  - Lesions on fruit stalks (peduncles) may girdle them, leading to fruit death.

**c. Leaf Blight (Phomopsis obscurans)**  
- **Early Symptoms:**  
  - Initial signs include circular reddish-purple spots on leaflets, typically along major veins.
- **Progression:**  
  - Lesions enlarge into V-shaped patterns with a light brown inner zone and dark brown outer zone.
  - Lesions can spread, causing the leaflet to turn brown.
  - Severe cases may affect stolons (runners), fruit trusses, and petioles, potentially leading to stem girdling and death.

### 2. Disease Life Cycle

**Leaf Spot**  
- **Overwintering:**  
  - Mycosphaerella fragariae overwinters in dead leaves and infected plant debris, with spores remaining viable in residues.
- **Development:**  
  - During early summer, the fungus produces new spores in leaf lesions.
  - Spores spread by rain, infecting healthy leaves.
  - Middle-aged leaves are most susceptible.

**Leaf Scorch**  
- **Overwintering:**  
  - Diplocarpon earliana survives on infected leaves and debris, remaining active in decomposing foliage and overwintering strawberries.
- **Development:**  
  - In spring, spore-producing structures form on old leaves.
  - Spores spread by water and wind, with rapid disease spread in wet conditions.
  - Older and middle-aged leaves are more susceptible.

**Leaf Blight**  
- **Overwintering:**  
  - Phomopsis obscurans survives as mycelium or fruiting bodies on old leaves attached to plants.
- **Development:**  
  - Spores are released in early spring and spread by rain.
  - The fungus is most destructive to older leaves during late summer.
  - Spores can also infect petioles, calyxes (flower caps), and fruit.

### 3. Preventive Measures

**Cultural and Chemical Control**  
- Apply chemical fungicides or microbial agents during late summer and fall (August to October).
- Use a mixture of Chinese herbal medicine extracts, copper sulfate, and fosetyl-aluminum in culture soil to prevent leaf blight and reduce pathogen resistance.
  
**Genetic Resistance**  
- Focus on breeding resistant genotypes.
- Cultivars like Vantage and Scotland show resistance to leaf scorch.

**Crop Rotation**  
- Rotate strawberries with non-host crops (e.g., legumes, grains) to reduce pathogen buildup.
- Avoid planting strawberries in the same location year after year.

**Resistant Varieties**  
- **For Leaf Spot and Leaf Scorch:**  
  - June-bearing: Allstar, Canoga, Cardinal, Delite, Earliglow, Honeoye, Jewell, Lester, Midway, Redchief.
  - Everbearing: Tribute, Tristar.

**Hygiene**  
- Remove older, infected leaves before planting new ones.
- Space plants adequately for good air circulation.
- Control weeds to reduce moisture retention around plants.
- After harvest, remove infected leaves and plant debris to lower inoculum levels.

### 4. Treatment Options

**Chemical and Microbial Treatments**  
- Apply treatments in August, September, and October for optimal control.
- Optimize fungicide use based on the severity of the disease (AUDPC values).
  
**Cultivar Selection**  
- Select resistant cultivars to reduce leaf scorch impact on growth and yield.
- **For Leaf Spot and Leaf Scorch:**  
  - Resistant: 'Jewel', 'Blomidon'.
  - Susceptible: 'Kent'.
  
**Organic Treatments**  
- **For Leaf Spot and Leaf Scorch:**  
  - Use compost tea, neem oil, or other natural fungicides.
- **For Leaf Blight:**  
  - Emphasize cultural practices, as organic treatments are limited.

### 5. Impact on Yield

- **Leaf Spot:** Reduces overall leaf area, weakening the plant, making it more susceptible to root diseases, and lowering fruit yield.
- **Leaf Scorch:** Decreases leaf vigor, reducing photosynthesis, fruit yield, and quality. Infected leaves may turn brown and fall off.
- **Leaf Blight:** Causes extensive leaf drop and can infect fruit trusses, leading to potential economic losses.

### 6. Disease-Resistant Crop Varieties

- **For Leaf Spot and Leaf Scorch:**  
  - Resistant varieties include Allstar, Canoga, Cardinal, Delite, Earliglow, Honeoye, Jewell, Lester, Midway, Redchief (June-bearing), Tribute, and Tristar (everbearing).
  
- **For Leaf Blight:**  
  - No specific resistant varieties. Focus on cultural practices and chemical treatments.

### 7. Environmental Factors

- **Weather Conditions:**  
  - Leaf diseases thrive under prolonged wetness and high humidity.
  - Warm temperatures and frequent rainfall can exacerbate disease spread.

- **Soil Conditions:**  
  - Well-drained soil with good air circulation reduces disease incidence.
  - Avoid poorly drained areas and overhead irrigation, as they increase humidity around plants.
