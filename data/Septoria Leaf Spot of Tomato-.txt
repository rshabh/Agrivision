### Septoria Leaf Spot of Tomato

---

**1. Symptoms of Each Disease**

**Early Diagnosis Symptoms:**
- **Initial Appearance:** Small, water-soaked, circular spots on the undersides of older leaves (1/16 to 1/8 inch in diameter).
- **Spot Characteristics:** Centers turn gray to tan with dark brown margins; numerous and distinctively circular spots.
- **Advanced Symptoms:** Spots enlarge and coalesce; leaves turn yellow, brown, shrivel, and drop off. Presence of small, dark-brown, pimple-like structures called pycnidia in the center of the spots.
- **Other Affected Parts:** Disease may also appear on petioles, stems, and calyx but is less common.

**2. Disease Life Cycle**

- **Inoculum Source:** Fungus *Septoria lycopersici* overwinters in infected tomato debris or Solanaceous weeds.
- **Spore Production:** Under wet conditions, the fungus produces spores (conidia) in fruiting bodies (pycnidia).
- **Dispersal:** Spores spread through windblown water, splashing rain, overhead irrigation, hands and clothing, and insects like Colorado potato beetles and aphids.
- **Infection and Spread:** Spores germinate when free moisture is present on leaves, leading to infection. New pycnidia form, initiating secondary cycles of infection.

**3. Preventive Measures**

- **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. In large fields, cover and bury debris by deep plowing.
- **Crop Rotation:** Avoid planting tomatoes or related crops (e.g., eggplant, potatoes) in the same location for 1–2 years.
- **Healthy Transplants:** Use disease-free transplants; rogue infected seedlings before planting.
- **Watering Practices:** Avoid overhead watering; water early in the day to ensure leaves dry quickly. Avoid working with wet plants.
- **Weed Control:** Eliminate weed hosts like nightshade and horsenettle.

**4. Treatment Options**

**Physical Treatment:**
- **Hot Water Treatment (HWT):** Treat tomato seeds at 48°C for 30 minutes to reduce disease severity and incidence. Improves germination and seedling vigor; offers a potential alternative to chemical fungicides.

**Chemical Treatments:**
- **Fungicides:** Use protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil and mancozeb. Apply as soon as symptoms are observed; repeat as necessary.
  - **Chlorothalonil:** Effective for controlling Septoria leaf spot; follow label instructions.
  - **Mancozeb:** Similar application guidelines as chlorothalonil.

**Organic Treatments:**
- **Copper-Based Fungicides:** Use copper hydroxide or copper sulfate for organic control.
- **Organic Mulch:** Apply a layer of organic mulch to reduce splashing of spores from the soil.

**Induced Resistance:**
- **Potassium Phosphite + L-α-Amino Acids:** Enhances tomato defense, reduces oxidative damage, maintains higher photosynthetic efficiency, and upregulates host defense genes.

**5. Impact on Yield**

- **Defoliation:** Significant leaf loss reduces photosynthesis, lowering fruit yields.
- **Sunscald:** Premature leaf drop exposes fruit to sunscald, affecting yield and quality.
- **Complete Crop Loss:** In severe cases, crop losses can reach up to 100%.

**6. Disease-Resistant Crop Varieties**

- **Resistant Varieties:** No commercial cultivars with complete resistance available, but some tomato lines show partial resistance and are used in breeding programs. Consult local extension services for resistant varieties.

---

**7. Environmental Factors**

- **Weather:** Warm, wet, and humid conditions favor disease development and spread. Extended periods of leaf wetness increase risk.
- **Soil Conditions:** Well-drained soils help reduce disease risk by preventing prolonged leaf wetness.
