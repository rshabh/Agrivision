#### **Northern Corn Leaf Blight (NCLB)**

**1. Overview**
   - **Description:** Northern Corn Leaf Blight (NCLB) is a disease caused by the fungus *Exserohilum turcicum* affecting corn. It leads to yield losses and is more prevalent in humid climates.
   - **Affected Crops:** Corn (*Zea mays*).

**2. Symptoms**
   - **Early Symptoms:**
     - **Lesion Appearance:** Long, narrow, tan lesions running parallel to leaf margins, expanding into oblong, cigar-shaped lesions.
     - **Color Changes:** Gray-green margins turning tan with possible dark fungal sporulation.
     - **Leaf Location:** Symptoms start on lower leaves and progress upwards.
   - **Advanced Symptoms:**
     - **Lesion Size:** 1 to 7 inches long.
     - **Spore Formation:** Olive-green or black spores making lesions appear dark.
     - **Leaf Damage:** Large areas of dead tissue leading to blighted leaves.

**3. Disease Life Cycle**
   - **Overwintering:** Pathogen survives on corn leaf debris and plant residues.
   - **Spore Production:** Occurs in spring and early summer from infected residues.
   - **Infection:** Spread by rain and air currents, requiring free water on leaf surfaces and temperatures between 65°F and 80°F.
   - **Secondary Spread:** Spores travel long distances by wind, causing secondary infections.
   - **Disease Progression:** Lesions spread from lower to upper leaves, influenced by humidity and temperature.

**4. Preventive Measures**
   - **Cultural Practices:**
     - **Resistant Varieties:** Use hybrids resistant to NLB (e.g., Jingzao 7, Guidan 16).
     - **Crop Rotation and Soil Management:** Rotate crops, deep ploughing, avoid continuous maize cropping.
     - **Intercropping and Fertilization:** Intercrop with soybeans, wheat, or peanuts; apply balanced fertilizers.
   - **Chemical Treatments:**
     - **Fungicide Application:** Use coumoxystrobin, tebuconazole, and azoxystrobin during flare opening.
     - **Insecticide Use:** Apply carbendazim and mancozeb if disease rate exceeds 70%.
   - **Eco-friendly Approaches:**
     - **Biological Control:** Use plant vaccines and biological bacteria like PJQN-G6.
     - **Botanical Oils and Bio-agents:** Clove oil and neem oil with Trichoderma viride.

**5. Treatment Options**
   - **Chemical Treatments:**
     - **Fungicides:** 
       - **Strobilurins:** Azoxystrobin, Pyraclostrobin.
       - **Triazoles:** Tebuconazole, Propiconazole.
       - **SDHIs:** Fluoxastrobin, Picoxystrobin.
     - **Application Timing:** Key growth stages (tasseling to early silking).
   - **Eco-friendly Management:**
     - **Essential Oils and Bio-agents:** Clove oil and Trichoderma viride effective in reducing disease and promoting growth.
   - **Integrated Disease Management:** Combine seed treatments with bio-agents and fungicides.

**6. Impact on Yield**
   - **Yield Reduction:** Up to 30% loss if early infection affects ear leaf or above.
   - **Photosynthesis Loss:** Reduced photosynthetic area affects grain fill and yield.
   - **Stalk Rot and Lodging:** Contributes to further yield impact.

**7. Disease-Resistant Crop Varieties**
   - **Pioneer Hybrids:** Hybrids with Ht genes (e.g., Ht1, Ht2).
   - **Other Brands:** Consult for varieties with demonstrated resistance.

**8. Environmental Factors**
   - **Weather Conditions:** NCLB thrives in cool to moderate temperatures and high humidity.
   - **Impact in Regions:** Significant yield losses under conducive conditions in regions like the U.S. Corn Belt and Nepal.

**9. Future Directions**
   - **Research:** Ongoing development of resistant varieties, cultural practices, and effective fungicides.
   - **Integrated Pest Management:** Combining multiple approaches for sustainable disease management.
